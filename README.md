# Spark Soccer
Building an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Spark and Databrick's Unified Analytics Platform. The pipeline is made up of 3 functional components: data engineering, data analysis, machine learning.

## The Data
The dataset used for this project was retrieved from the [Football Events](https://www.kaggle.com/secareanualin/football-events/version/1) Kaggle competition.

## Data Engineering
The ETL is split into three parts: data extraction, data transformation, data loading.

## Data Analytics
Performed data analysis to gain a better understanding of goal distribution by shot place, by different leagues, by player position in Spanish soccer, and by time intervals.

## Machine Learning
Used a gradient-boosted tree classifier to fit a model to predict which conditions can lead to a goal.
